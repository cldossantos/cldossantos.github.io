## About

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Agronomy department at Iowa State University. Most of my research is focused on utilizing crop models, such as the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) to assess spatial and temporal variability of cropping systems. The goal is to assess the risk associated with different management decisions.

## Research interests

There are several research areas that fascinate me. A short list of those would be: crop physiology, crop models, remote sensing, soil fertility, and statistical models.
