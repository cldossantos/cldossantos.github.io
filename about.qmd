## About

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Agronomy at Iowa State University, with an interest in data science, statistics, and process-based model applications in agriculture. Alongside my Ph.D. in Crop Production and Physiology, I am also working toward a Minor in Statistics. My research focuses on using digital tools- such as yield monitors, remotely sensed data, and crop models- to quantify and manage the spatio-temporal variability of cropping systems for efficient crop production.

## Research interests

There are several research areas that fascinate me. A short list of those would be: crop physiology, crop models, remote sensing, soil fertility, and statistical models.
